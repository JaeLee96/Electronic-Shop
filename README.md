As a frequent user of online exchange and shopping websites such as OfferUp, Craiglist, and Amazon, I decided to make my own 
*almost* fully functional E-Commercie personal website in HTML5, CSS3, React.js. Also used PayPal's REST APIs

I've implemented an user interface where users can view the products, their descriptions, price, models, and then add them to their shopping carts.
