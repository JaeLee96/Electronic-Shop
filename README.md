As a frequent user of online exchange apps such as OfferUp, Craiglist, and Amazon, I've decided to create my customized personal E-Commerce website. It is *almost* fully functional with some debuggings to be done. I've used HTML5, CSS3, React.js, and PayPal's API endpoints to make this project.

A user can view products, products' descriptions, price, and reviews (for future), and add the products they want to the shopping cart
